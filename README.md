# LightOutSolver
with Backtracking Algorithm.

Hi, this programm is the solver of Lights Out Puzzle (about 2 states).

I used Backtracking in Java.

The First Input is n, means row and column. (n by n)
The Second Input value '#' is turned off, 'O'(Uppercase o, but never mind) is turned on.

example)
5
# # # # #
# # # # #
# # # # #       => means all turned off.
# # # # #
# # # # #
